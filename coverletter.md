Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to enquire about the opening for the front end engineer position. I offer the experience required to develop responsive, multi-platform and performant web applications using React along with the ability to work independently and learn quickly. With hands-on experience, I have successfully integrated APIs, optimized performance through lazy loading techniques, and implemented secure authentication measures.

My E-Portfolio below highlights my strong skills for frontend development, along with other skills that also align with this position.

I welcome the opportunity to speak with you if you feel I will be a strong candidate for this or any other position in your organisation.

Kind regards,
Wesley Liaw
